# MetaSite

\*Has **absolutely zilch** affiliation with Meta or the """""_Metaverse_"""""

MetaSite is a site that tries to be meta. Not too meta though â€“ just a little bit.

_In progress_

- Set a global timer
  - Add speedrun functionality (snapshots times upon triggers)
- Make a button and/or trigger that plays sound
- Make a random page button
- Save in localstorage palettes/themes

_Big Interactions_

- Sliding transition animation and layout of pages
  - Corresponding minimap of site pages

It discusses:

- distinctions between coding, programming and (software) engineering,
- about learning in general (and provides a few key pointers for learning on the web development side),
- about projects & authenticity,
- comparisons of self and community and fulfilment,
- about discomfort & failure,
- about existence of the web and existence as a human being
- about social relationships and the network of history & geography, language & art

MetaSite doesn't care about your opinions and loves you dearly. It was and is definitely not made by someone drifting upon the deafening, turbulent waves of existential malaise, on one end, unable to really come to terms with the sheer multiplicity of being a person in this day and age with interpretative values being thrown about in a world that, in some of those interpretations, comes across sometimes as absurd and meaningless.
